# HR Presence Insights Dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project is an **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using **Excel** and **Power BI** to analyze employee presence data. The dashboard provides insights into attendance patterns, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and leave percentages across different time periods and days of the week.

The dataset contains employee-level attendance records, and the dashboard transforms this raw data into meaningful business insights for HR teams and management.
